# LineImageListItems (LILI)
[LineImageListItems](https://github.com/Stevemaster92/LineImageListItems) is an easy-to-use library which provides default list items, adapters, and list fragments fitting daily Android development when working with lists.
It employs the following Android components and patterns:

- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView) for flexible list views and layouts.
- [ViewHolder](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder) for easy data-view binding.
- [SwipeRefreshLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/swiperefreshlayout/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout) for gesture-based data refreshing.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/LiveData) for lifecycle-aware background data loading.
    
The library includes pre-defined layouts for the different list items which can be adjusted to personal needs.
Furthermore, one can easily extend the basic functions of the provided models, adapters, and fragments by creating sub classes of each component.

## Getting started
At the moment, only an Android Archive (AAR) file of the library exists.
Work on a more convenient, Maven-/Gradle-based solution is still going on.
In order to use it:

 1. Download the library from [here](https://github.com/Stevemaster92/LineImageListItems/raw/master/lili/lili-release.aar).
 2. Copy the downloaded AAR file to `app/libs/` of your Android project.
 3. Add the following to your project `build.gradle`
  ```gradle
  repositories {
      flatDir {
          dirs 'libs'
      }
  }
  ```

 4. Add the following to your app `build.gradle`
 ```gradle
 dependencies {
   implementation(name: 'lili-release', ext: 'aar')
 }
 ```
 
 5. In Android Studio, select **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files** or click **Sync Now**.
 6. Import the desired Java classes and resource files.

## Documentation
