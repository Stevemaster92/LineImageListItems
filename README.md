# LineImageListItems (LILI)
[LineImageListItems](https://github.com/Stevemaster92/LineImageListItems) is an easy-to-use library which provides default list items, adapters, and list fragments fitting daily Android development with [ListView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html)s.
The library is implemented in a way such that custom changes to the layout of the different list items can be made easily.
Furthermore, one can extend the functionalities of the provided models, adapters, and fragments to their personal usage and create own classes of each component.

## Getting started
At the moment, only an Android Archive (AAR) file of the library exists.
Work on a more convenient, Maven-/Gradle-based solution is still going on.
In order to use the library:

 1. Download the library from [here](https://github.com/Stevemaster92/LineImageListItems/raw/master/lili/lili-release.aar).
 2. Copy the downloaded AAR file to `app/libs/` of your Android project.
 3. Add the following to your project level `build.gradle`
  ```gradle
  repositories {
      flatDir {
          dirs 'libs'
      }
  }
  ```

 4. Add the following to your app `build.gradle`
 ```gradle
 dependencies {
   compile(name: 'lili-release', ext: 'aar')
 }
 ```
 
 5. In Android Studio, select **Tools > Android > Sync Project with Gradle Files** or click **Sync Now**.
